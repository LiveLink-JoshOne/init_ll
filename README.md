# init_ll
Initialize LL sessions for Ubuntu
Also includes package installation automation for freshly-installed Ubuntu workstations

## Installation:
$ cd /path/to/init_ll
$ sudo bash install.sh         ## Feel free to open this file and install the files yourself if you want more control over what goes onto your workstation

## Usage:
$ init_llts OR $ init_llice
If these fail to work, re-run the symlink commands from the install script
